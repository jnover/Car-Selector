# Car-Selector
A simple React.js web app for displaying car information.

**Steps**:
1. Examine the JSON in the link above
2. Initialize a public github repo that you can share with me
3. Commit often as you work through the project so I can see your steps
4. Use create-react-app to create a react app https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html
5. Get rid of the default layout and create a simple layout with some padding for content
6. Create a search input text field that filters the list of cars as you type.  Should be searchable by all properties in the JSON
7. Use an accordion-like component from whatever library you want - e.g. https://material-ui.com/components/accordion/
8. The heading of the accordion/card should show the year make model and price nicely formatted
9. When you expand the card it should show the details like VIN, dealer cost, the details of the lot

* No tests needed, no extra work, nothing fancy.
